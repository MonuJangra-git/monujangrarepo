## Purpose
This file documents my ideas and future plans for the authentication project.  
It serves as a roadmap for upgrades and improvements.

## Current Features
- Random credential generation (username/password).  
- Validation logic for authentication.  
- Clean commit messages and documentation practices.  

## Future Upgrades
- Add multi-factor authentication (MFA).  
- Implement secure password hashing (bcrypt/SHA-256).  
- Store credentials in JSON or database for persistence.  
- Introduce role-based access control (RBAC).  
- Add logging with timestamps for login attempts.  
- Improve error handling and user feedback.  
- Create a user-friendly CLI or GUI interface.  

## Integration Plan
- This file is placed in the main project folder to keep documentation and code together.  
- Updates will be tracked with GitHub commits for clarity.  

## Long-Term Vision
- Continuously upgrade authentication features for portfolio value.  
- Align enhancements with cloud security and networking fundamentals.  
- Showcase practical, hands-on security implementations for career relevance.
